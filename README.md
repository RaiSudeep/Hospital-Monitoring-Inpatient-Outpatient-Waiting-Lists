# PowerBI-Hospital-Patient-Wait-List-
This Power BI project leverages healthcare data on inpatient cases to visualise patient wait times, case types, and specialties. The interactive dashboard includes summary and detailed views, enabling stakeholders to monitor trends, compare performance, and make data-driven decisions for enhancing patient care and operational efficiency.

## Data Overview:
The project utilises healthcare data, specifically focusing on inpatient cases, which include two types: Day Cases (patients admitted for one day) and Inpatient Cases (patients admitted for more than one day). The data sources contain information on speciality HIPE, speciality name, patient wait times, case types, adult/child, age profiles, and the number of total tients. The data undergoes thorough transformation and modelling to ensure accuracy and relevance in the final dashboard.

## Dashboard Usage:
The dashboard is designed to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into patient wait times across different case types and specialties. It features an interactive layout with summary and detailed pages. The summary page offers a high-level overview, including current and previous-year comparisons, average wait times by speciality, and monthly trends. The detailed page allows users to drill down into granular data, filtering by specific metrics such as month, case type, and specialty.Â  This dashboard is particularly useful for healthcare administrators and decision-makers to monitor performance, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions to improve patient care and operational efficiency.
